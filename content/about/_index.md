### Introduction

Hi my name is Daniel, I'm a human-centred UX designer.

My creative journey started all the way back in 2018 – after leaving a Content Manager role at ASOS to follow my passion for creativity, visual arts and graphic design.

Over the years I've dabbled in all types of design – from store front POS and insurance brochures, to visual branding for a Personal Trainer and website design for a SASS startup.

I fell in love with human-centred design during the Sydney Global Goals Jam in 2019 – where I worked alongside other like-minded souls to help develop a response to the pressing needs of electrical waste and sustainability.

My long-term vision is to utilise design for the benefit of humanity, and to create impact for our society and our environment.

### My Values

##### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held

In a challenging environment, I don't shy away from the hard questions but embrace them with an open mind. Listening and learning helps me to discover root causes. Vision and purpose helps to me to deliver positive change.
