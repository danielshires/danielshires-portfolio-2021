<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>Dale and James approached me to help develop a brand identity and website for MASO Fitness, a new personal training and outdoor fitness group in Sydney’s Inner West.
</p>
<p>The brief was to create a vibrant and energetic brand identity with a bold colour scheme.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>From research and development from their target brands, through to logo ideation and brand idenity – I developed a vibrant and outgoing brand that refletcted their fun and active fitness classes.</p>
