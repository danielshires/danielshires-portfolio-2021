## Overview

Mementio is 

> One of the key products is connecting disabled clients with disability service providers through a VIP matching service.

## Challenge 

My Care Space needed help with evaluating and enhancing our user journey and experience.

They were unsure if people find the website easy to use and wanted to know answers to the following questions.

* Are users able to search for the service they need using the right criteria?

* Do they know that we can connect them with providers (not just information) and visa versa?

They found that people visiting the website looking for information did not realise that MyCareSpace could help them find services and connect them with service providers.

## Goals

To review the existing UX flow for connecting users with My Care Space, and to advise on improvements to the directory and resource library.

## Discover

As designers we needed to understand the problem space before coming up with solutions. We knew that the website had usability issues, but we needed to validate our assumptions about the website with users. 

#### Understanding the Problem

The first steps were to run three seperate Zoom interviews with users that had never previously visited MyCareSpace, but were either looking for information about NDIS for themselves, or on behalf of a client.

#### Interview Objectives

* To better understand the users user of digital products in the NDIS space

* To understand the users knowledge and use of My Care Space

* To run a homepage usability test to see how the user would engage in contact with My Care Space

## Define

After the research phase, it was time to bring together all of our findings and generate insights to help drive the next phase of the project.

We made notes on a shared Miro board and used Affinity Mapping to help collect and organise themes from the interviews.

#### Key Insights

We learnt through talking to users that there were some consistent themes and issues.

* __Users didn't immediately understand the purpose of the website â€“ or what service MyCareSpace provided.__ 

    The website homepage was confusing, the messaging unclear and the imagery did not tell a story.

* __The contact form felt tedious and parts of it were unclear and too hard to read.__
    
    When faced with filling out a form to contact MyCareSpace, users were put off and decided to exit the page instead.

    Users just want to call sometimes, and the number was too hard to find on the website.

* __The website homepage was confusing, the messaging unclear and the imagery did not tell a story.__
   
    When running the usability test, users struggled with small text and low-contrast between colours, and found it difficult to navigate around the site.
