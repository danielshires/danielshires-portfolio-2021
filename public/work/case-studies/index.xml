      <description>ðŸ“‹ Overview The Challenge MyCareSpace is a national online platform that connects people living with a disability, their families and carers, with easy to read information about the NDIS.
The team had a problem. They were unsure if people found the website easy to use and wanted to know answers to the following questions.
  Do visitors know that we can connect them with NDIS service providers?
  Are users able to search easily for the service they need, without needing our help?</description>
