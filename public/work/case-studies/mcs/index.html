<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<p><strong>MyCareSpace</strong> is a national online platform that connects people living with a disability, their families and carers, with easy to read information about the NDIS.</p>
<p>The team had a problem. They were unsure if people found the website easy to use and wanted to know answers to the following questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do visitors know that we can connect them with NDIS service providers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are users able to search easily for the service they need, without needing our help?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Highlight</strong></p>
<p>One of their key products is connecting disabled clients with disability service providers through a &lsquo;VIP&rsquo; matching service.</p>
</blockquote>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>
<p>The primary goal was to review the existing UX flow for connecting users with My Care Space through the &lsquo;VIP&rsquo; contact form.</p>
<p>We also needed to understand more about the users of MyCareSapce, their feelings and perceptions towards using connection services, and how they used NDIS in their day-to-day lives.</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<p>For this project, our team of five used the double diamond technique to help guide our decisions and to help provide a framework for developing a human-centred design.</p>

<h2 id="-discover">🔎 Discover</h2>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>For the discovery phase, we decided to run 1-2-1 user interviews to provide us with direct insights from users.</p>
<p>For our user interviews – we wanted to talk to users that often looked for information about NDIS services for themselves, or on behalf of a client.</p>
<p>Our goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To understand how users search for NDIS service providers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To understand the common problems, feelings and perceptions when using connection services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To run a short task analysis to see how users would go about contacting MyCareSpace</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="organising-data">Organising Data</h3>
<p>After the research phase, it was time to bring together all of our findings and generate insights to help drive the next phase of the project.</p>
<p>We made notes on a shared Miro board and used affinity mapping to help organise the data into groups and themes.</p>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/mcs-affinity-map.png"
         alt="My Care Space"/>
</figure>

<h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h3>
<p>We learnt through talking to users that there were some consistent themes and issues. After discussing the findings together as a group, we generated the following insights.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Users didn&rsquo;t immediately understand the purpose of the website.</strong></p>
<p>The website homepage was confusing, the brand messaging was unclear and the imagery did not tell a story.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <h4>MyCareSpace Homepage</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<p><strong>The VIP form was unclear and too hard to read.</strong></p>
<p>When faced with filling out a form to contact MyCareSpace, users were put off by the number of fields to complete and decided to exit the page instead.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>The contact number was too hard to find. When it was shown, it was too small and not easily visible.</strong></p>
<p>Users just want to call sometimes, and the number was too hard to find on the website.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3 id="user-personas">User Personas</h3>
<p>Based on our interview we created user personas for the two main visitors to MyCareSpace – carers and clients. This would help us design with the end-users in mind.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="reframing-the-problem">Reframing the Problem</h3>
<p>After reviewing our insights, we re-framed the original brief into a problem statement.</p>
<p>After discussions with MyCareSpace, we decided to use the persona of the &lsquo;The Carer&rsquo; as the primary user we would be designing for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
<p>At the start of their search for NDIS providers, disability carers visit the MyCareSpace website looking for information and feel confused.</p>
<p>They do not realise that MyCareSpace can help them connect with NDIS service providers.</p>
<p>They want to connect with MyCareSpace to answer questions they might have about NDIS, but are unsure of how to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After generating the problem statement, we created several &lsquo;How Might We&rsquo; statements. We chose three of them to form the basis for ideation, and to help guide the rest of our design process in the &lsquo;Develop&rsquo; phase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How might we&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Simplify the process of contacting MyCareSpace, so that users don&rsquo;t feel put off by filling out an endless form?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How might we&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Make it easier for carers to contact MCS about services or providers, so they can get a quicker response to their questions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How might we&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Better communicate the services that MyCareSpace offers so that users understand know what to do next?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="-develop">✏️ Develop</h2>
<h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
<p>For the ideation phase, <strong>we focused on the key problems and pain points felt by our users</strong> — that they did not understand what services MyCareSpace offered, that it was difficult to contact them quickly.</p>
<p>To address issues with contacting MyCareSpace, <strong>we decided to focus on improving the VIP service matching form.</strong></p>
<p>When brainstorming ideas we came up with the following features and requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To be able to collect basic contact information from users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To collect personalised information about their current journey in NDIS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To guide users through the form process and reduce overall cognitive load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide easy access to contact MyCareSpace directly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide resolution at the end of the form, and reassure users that MyCareSpace would reply quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <h4>Our team brainstormed ideas and shared using the Crazy 8&#39;s technique</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="user-journey">User Journey</h3>
<p>For the user journey, we started with a basic user flow that would highlight the validations needed at different points of the journey.</p>
<p>We wanted to give the users the control to go back when needed, and also to review the form at the end before the pressed submit.</p>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/mcs-userjourney.png"
         alt="User Journey"/><figcaption>
            <h4>We created the user journey collaboratively using Miro</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="-deliver">🚀 Deliver</h2>
<h3 id="the-new-homepage">The New Homepage</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A Refreshed Look</strong></p>
<p>The new hompeage is streamlined to reduce clutter. We also added hero image matched with an inspiring quote.</p>
<p>Overall, we felt it was important to simplify and reduce the amount of clutter on the homepage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/mcs-homepage-new.jpg"
         alt="New Hompepage"/><figcaption>
            <h4>The new homepage kept the typeface and colour scheme from the existing brand.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Updated messaging</strong></p>
<p>Our users were confused about the purpose of the site – <strong>so we updated the hero message to make it clear that MyCareSpace connects you with disability support services</strong>.</p>
<p>We also removed a lot of the clutter around the search bar, and added a direct CTA to the free matching service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/mcs-routes.jpg"
         alt="New Hompepage"/><figcaption>
            <h4>Two clear CTAs reduce the amount of time a user has to make a decision.</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Call When You Need To</strong></p>
<p>Our users wanted to contact MyCareSpace directly by phone, but they found it hard to find a direct number they could call.</p>
<p>So we added a contact number to the site header, <strong>to give users a direct way of contacting MyCareSpace from all pages on the website</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/mcs-contact-number.jpg"

</figure>

<h3 id="the-new-matching-service">The New Matching Service</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Introducing the Service</strong></p>
<p>To help on-board users, we started with re-designing the intro page to show what the service does, and the benefits it would provide.</p>
<p>We also provided social proof using large marketing images, with quotes that re-affirmed the success of the service.</p>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/form/mcs-form-intro.jpg"

            <h4>The new form keeps all information on a single page, with no scrolling required</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmenting the Form</strong></p>
<p>Our users were put off by the long form on the VIP page – so we broke up the form into smaller chunks and reduced the overall cognitive load.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="pt-3 pb-5 align-centre"><img src="/work/case-studies/images/mcs/form/mcs-form-01.jpg"
         alt="Contact Form Introduction"/><figcaption>
            <h4>We added navigation at the top of form to show users their progress through the form</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple Choice</strong></p>
<p>Instead of asking users to type out or select choices from a lenghty drop-downlist, we added live searchable fields that respond as you type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
