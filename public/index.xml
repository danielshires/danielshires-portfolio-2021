      <description>Explore Visual Research As part of the concept development, I did a competitor and brand analysis based on the clients preference and inspiration for the look and feel.
  Explore Logo Development I created a number of directions for the logo, trying different variations from simple to complex.
  Explore Logo Design The concept for final logo mark was to emphasise the fluid and expressive motions in exercise. Keywords such as â€˜springâ€™, â€˜energyâ€™ and â€˜flowâ€™ were selected in the brainstorming phase.</description>

      <description>ðŸ“‹ Overview The Challenge MyCareSpace is a national online platform that connects people living with a disability, their families and carers, with easy to read information about the NDIS.
The team had a problem. They were unsure if people found the website easy to use and wanted to know answers to the following questions.
  Do visitors know that we can connect them with NDIS service providers?
  Are users able to search easily for the service they need, without needing our help?</description>
